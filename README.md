# Neon Hoverboard

## About The Project

This is a mini hoverboard canvas, everytime your hover over the square a different color appears and leaves a trace. You can use this as is for fun, add to your projects or learn the methods. You can also remove the 'removeColor' function and use this as a drawing canvas.
You can make the transitions faster or slower, and you can add or remove as many colors as you want to the colors array.
